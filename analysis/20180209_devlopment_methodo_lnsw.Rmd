# Aim 

* Produce a Low Nutrient SeaWater (LNSW) 

# Introduction

The last experiment showed that the Synthetic Sea Water (SSW) is too concentrated in nutrients. Hansen and Koroleff [-@Hansen2007a] advise the use of LNSW. The LNSW is the surface seawater collected in late spring or summer filtered and stored in dark several weeks. 

We can't collect the water in the sea. So That we use a mesocosme sea water and SSW to prepare a LNSW. We must be use several cycle light/dark for phytoplankton and bacteria draw nutrients.

# M&M

We draw and filtered water in mesocosm. 

We prepare
